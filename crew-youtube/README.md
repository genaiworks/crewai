AGI Artificial General Intelligence:
The ultimate goal in AGI is to create an agent that is able to perform any task that a human being is capable of. A core capability required for such an agent is to be able to continuously learn new skills and use its learned skills to learn more complicated skills faster.These skills must be broken up into sub-tasks, where the agent interacts with the environment, learning from its failures until success. nd upon learning a new skill, the agent should integrate the skill into its existing repertoire of acquired skills for the future.
